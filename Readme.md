# CySpark Web Framework
CySpark is a lightweight web framework built using Cython and Python. It aims to provide high performance and efficiency by leveraging Cython's ability to compile Python-like code into optimized C or C++ code.

## Features
- **Performance**: Cython compilation results in faster execution compared to interpreted Python, making it suitable for applications requiring high throughput and low latency.
- **Customization**: Built for flexibility, CySpark allows developers to design and integrate specific features and optimizations tailored to their application's needs.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing C libraries, enabling direct utilization of high-performance modules for specialized tasks.
- **Control**: Provides low-level control over memory management and performance-critical operations, optimizing resource utilization.
- **Open for Improvements**: CySpark is an open-source project, welcoming contributions and enhancements from the community.
